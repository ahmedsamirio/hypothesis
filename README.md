# hypothesis-test

hypothesis-test is a python package for running hypothesis tests directly on pandas dataframes.

# Installation 

## Dependencies

hypothesis-test requires:
* Python (>=3.7)
* NumPy (>= 1.19.2)
* pandas (>= 1.1.3)
* matplotlib (>= 3.3.2)

# Project Motivation

This project was done after writing several classes and functions to run multiple hypothesis tests on a pandas dataframe for an analysis, which later inspired me to package them and use them easily at anytime, and share them as they might be useful to other people as well.


# Usage

The package until now is designed to run a hypothesis test of difference in a feature average between two groups. So you need to have two groups that you want to figure out the presence of a statistical difference between.

```python
test = HypothesisTest(df, group_feature, test_feature)
```

`group_feature` if the feature that divided the dataframe into two groups, which should be a binary feature with 1 for positive group and 0 for negative group.  
`test_feature` is the feature whose average difference will be tested for significance using bootstraped samples from the dataframe.
